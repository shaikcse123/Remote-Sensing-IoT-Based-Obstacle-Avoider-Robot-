# Remote-Sensing-IoT-Based-Obstacle-Avoider-Robot-

Project Description:

An obstacle avoidance Robot is designed in order to navigate the robotic in unknown surroundings by avoiding collisions. Obstacle heading off robot senses barriers in the course, keep away from it, and resumes its strolling. An ultrasonic sensor is used to come across any obstacle in advance of it and sends a command to the micro-controller. This assignment will result in a robot that could move with the instructions and may visit a remote abstruse area to accumulate statistics and assist people. It will method the practice through microcontroller Arduino and pass the robot by way of following the commands in the algorithm. Wherever our robot is going it's going to feel temperature and humidity datasets. It will accumulate facts from there and ship the accumulated facts to a cloud database thru Wi-Fi and the internet. Detection effects additionally depend on the weather situations and the sensing reliability of the DHT11 sensor decreases with moisture and humidity. In our gadget, we have designed a low-value Microcontroller Based obstacle-avoiding Robot. The robotic will move forward, backward, left, and proper path by means of following the instructions given by the algorithm. This machine can be beneficial for numerous causes. And we have provided a basic algorithm and layout which may be further stepped forward depending upon the required packages.
